# Tombola
Tombola is a new primitive that will allow for any developer to create an raffle expereinces using cNFTS for their projects without the need for approval or reaching certain threshold/stipulations of other raffle expereince providers on the market today. 

Tombola is one part protocol and one part open source front end: The protocol is powerful and flexible, it can allow developers to create things we've yet to see in a raffle experience, such as raffling any sort of spl-token. The front end will allow teams to quickly setup new raffle sites if they don't have one already, allowing them to customize it to their hearts content and align it to their brand identity.

#### This is the frontend to interact with the cnft raffle program and can be used by other developer's to create their own headless cnft raffle experience

> one such example could be to use it with solarplex frames
